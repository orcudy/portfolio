Greetings you *beautiful people*!   

I'm Chris Orcutt and you've found my small home on the Internet. I created this portfolio of projects to give you a better understanding of who I am. Many people would say that I’m kind of all over the place, and they would be right. I like to keep things interesting and I have a track record to prove it:

* I have an **extraordinarily creative spirit** and share myself with the world through the music/poetry/stories I write and the way that I move my body on the dance floor. I’ve designed and launched an urban clothing label ([xActivist](https://represent.com/store/xactivist)), have been the creative director/photographer/model/editor on multiple photo and video shoots ([Melona](https://youtu.be/zq4Tb_XMaAA) & [Buttercups](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5acw6208v43pu3n/AABH46BRZ7N-vX3jNIoF67eJa?dl=0)), composed and performed original songs to 100’s of people ([Live@SummerFest](https://www.facebook.com/orcudy/videos/1565031503518830/)), maintain an online publication of poems about love, live, & finding meaning([Letters to my Lovers](https://medium.com/letters-to-my-lovers)), and maintain a personal blog on my experiences and views with happiness, sex, and drugs ([@chrisorcutt](https://medium.com/@chrisorcutt)). 

* I am an **empathetic communicator, teacher, and student**. I have been the community manager of an extraordinarily diverse learning community in San Francisco, taught both high school students and career changing adults in a variety of subjects ranging from English to chemistry to software application development, and have wrote a book (well, an online tutorial) on building iOS applications. 

* I have the **analytical skills** of a UCLA trained computer scientist. I’ve built autonomous robots, remote controlled quad-copters, and have been involved in designing, developing, and releasing 13 apps to the Apple App Store.

* And if that's not interesting enough for you, I quit my cushy job at Facebook in 2016 to undertake a **journey to find truth** that currently has me farming in Northern Washington! 

I choose to live differently, to be inspired, to be interested and interesting. Here's what I've worked on in the past. If you like what you see, give me a shout at orcutt.chris@gmail.com.
