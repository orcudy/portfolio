This repository is home to all of my most recent projects and includes links to source code, video demos, or App Store links where appropriate. Enjoy!

### Embedded

* Picam | [video demo](https://vimeo.com/152344182), [full info](https://github.com/orcudy/index/wiki/Picam)  
Picam is a camera system that can be controlled via a mobile device. It was built on the Raspberry Pi platform and consists of an application server (using raw sockets in Python), servo based control mechanism (using GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi), and iOS app interface (built in Swift 2.0). Picam was built at IDEAHacks 2016 at UCLA. A retrospective of my experiences building Picam can be found [here](https://medium.com/@orcudy/picam-a-retrospective-of-ideahacks-faaa60e8aeb1#.z1xu6qhhb).

* Dumbo | [flight video](https://vimeo.com/album/3693518/video/147213131) | [full info](https://github.com/orcudy/index/wiki/Dumbo)  
Dumbo is a remote-controlled quad copter that was built from off the shelf parts in preparation (to learn how a quad copter flies and the components that go into a quad copter) for building an autonomous drone controllable through a mobile interface. The entire process of building Dumbo was documented and can be found [here](https://medium.com/@orcudy/the-journey-begins-ee7f7fdcb160#.2vsc9osta).

* Medusa | [video demo](http://bit.ly/demo-medusa ) | [full info](https://github.com/orcudy/index/wiki/Medusa)  
Medusa is an autonomous maze navigating robot built using the Arduino platform and won 2nd place at the UCLA Open Project Space Robotics Race.

* Simon 2.0 | [dideo demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-aSRVm62rg)  
Simon 2.0 is a clone of Hasbro's popular game, Simon, and was built using the Arduino platform. 

* High Roller | [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKFtmWaHXI)  
High Roller is an electronic die that was built using the Arduino platform. 

### C/C++

* RDTP | [source](https://github.com/orcudy/RDTP)  
RDTP is an implementation of the Go-Back-N protocol and provides reliable data transfer over UDP.  

* HTTPServer | [source](https://github.com/orcudy/HTTPServer)  
The HTTPServer project is an implementation of a basic HTTP server that supports serving webpages containing JPG and GIF images.

### Lisp

* LispUtilities | [source](https://github.com/orcudy/LispUtilities)  
The LispUtilities project contains utilities (and a myriad of tests) for manipulating x, y coordinates by manhattan distance, common list operations (inserting into list, index of element in list, etc.), and common grid (2D lists) operations (extracing a value at a specific coordinate, finding the number of occurrences of a specific symbol, etc).

### iOS

#### Apps
* UCLALibrary | [source](https://github.com/orcudy/UCLALibrary) | [video demo](https://vimeo.com/album/3693502/video/148405704) | [Full Info](https://github.com/orcudy/index/wiki/UCLALibrary)  
UCLALibrary is a utility app created to provide real-time operating hours, rental laptop availability, and navigation to all 11 of UCLA's libraries. The project is being written in Swift 2.0 and will be released to the App Store in the near future.

* eWeek | [source](https://github.com/orcudy/eWeek) | [video demo](https://vimeo.com/album/3693502/video/148404888) | [full info](https://github.com/orcudy/index/wiki/eWeek)  
eWeek is a utility app that was built to accompany the annual Engineering Week event hosted at UCLA and serves as a real-time leaderboard and schedule of events. The project was written in Swift 1.0, used Parse for the backend, and Interface Builder for the interface; it was [released](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=981637936&mt=8) to the App Store in Spring, 2015.

* Biplanes | [source](https://github.com/orcudy/Biplanes) | [video demo](https://vimeo.com/album/3693502/video/103840072) | [full info](https://github.com/orcudy/index/wiki/Biplanes)  
Biplanes is a game that was built in 8 weeks during the Make Summer Academy in 2014. The project was written in Objective-C using SpriteBuilder and was [released](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/biplanes!/id904104087?ls=1&mt=8!)  to the App Store in Summer, 2014.

* Speed | [source](https://github.com/orcudy/Speed)  
Speed is a simple two player game that was created to teach iOS development to novice developers. The project was written in Swift 2.0, using UIKit for all interface elements; it will not be released to the App Store.

#### Modules

* COMapView | [source](https://github.com/orcudy/COMapView) | [video demo](https://vimeo.com/album/3693502/video/148405026)  
The COMapView project provides a kick-ass and easy to use class that allows developers to create (via Interface Builder or programmatically) map views with a great looking footer, tap to open Apple maps functionality, and custom map annotations.

* CODataManager | [source](https://github.com/orcudy/CODataManager)  
The CODataManager project provides a data management class consisting of an HTTP client and data persistence mechanism. CODataManager was created to be used by other iOS developers to simplify the process of fetching, parsing, and caching data.

* COCircleIndicator | [source](https://github.com/orcudy/COCircleIndicator)  
The COCircleIndicator project provides an easy to use class that allows for creation of animated indicator circles. COCircleIndicator was created to be used by other iOS developers to simplify the process of creating a good looking circle animation.
